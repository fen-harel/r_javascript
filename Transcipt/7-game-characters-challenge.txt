>> Bianca Gandolfo: So this is a creative exercise where we're going to create a clue game and represent it as an object in array. So let me tell you a little bit about what is in a Clue game, so that you can effectively approach this problem. So there are a few things.

[00:00:21]
And you don't need to do all of these, but I'm just gonna give you sort of a rundown, and you can choose whatever you think is important. It's more of a creative exercise. And there's no one right way to do it. So, obviously it's a board game, right.

[00:00:34]
So you have pieces and a board, and stuff like that. So if you really wanna represent the visual aspect of the Clue game. You can think about the different pieces that there are. So there's pieces for the characters. There are different cards for the two, so there's different characters.

[00:00:54]
There are weapons and there are rooms in this game. And there is a card that looks like this is called confidential. Inside of this card there are three things, there's the murderer, there's the room, and there's the weapon. And so, no one see it until the very end.

[00:01:17]
The whole process of the game is to figure out which cards are in this envelope because everyone else has all the other cards. So you need to figure out who the other cards, to figure out which cards are missing to make a good guess as to what is inside of this envelope.

[00:01:40]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So the data is characters, right? And you can make up character names if you want. They usually correspond with different colors, weapons, keep it, I don't know. Actually do whatever you want. And then rooms. And this is kind of a old school game, so the rooms are like the parlor and the billiard.

[00:02:07]

>> Speaker 2: The conservatory.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, the conservatory, and the library. And the weapons are like the candlestick or a lead pipe. Stuff like that. So, that's your task.
