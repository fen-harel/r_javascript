>> Bianca Gandolfo: In conclusion, I just made this slide for people who try to cheat. So before we reveal the big reveal, I wanna talk a little bit more about next steps, and how to apply these skills. So what we did over the past couple of days is we learned how to implement functional utility methods.

[00:00:20]
Maybe some of you had used them before at work or saw them around in documentation for various frameworks. But most people haven't had a chance to take the time and implement them. And so we didn't, we implemented them and we learned a lot along the way around scope, functions, objects, arrays, all of the core fundamentals of JavaScript.

[00:00:45]
We did it in ES5, and we applied some ES6 concepts on top of it just to bring it up to a more modern standard. And as far as next steps I recommend, if you'd really like to learn more about functional programming. Everything you've learned in the past couple days can be applied to a future course in functional programming.

[00:01:08]
You can learn more about architecting your code in a functional way and composing these different utility methods in creative ways to write your code more effectively.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: That's about it. And the murderer is, does anyone know?
>> Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: No, the murderer is you guys cuz you killed it.

>> Group: [LAUGH] Aah!
>> Speaker 4: Do not edit that out.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] That's it!
>> Speaker 5: I have to go.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 6: Cue the music.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Speaker 7: [LAUGH] Cue the music.
