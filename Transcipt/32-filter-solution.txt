[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we just spent some time implementing our own version of filter and let's go through the solution. All right, so we are going to write a filter similar to one in Lodash or Underscore. So I'm gonna set up my Underscore. Let me also set up my syntax highlighting.

[00:00:23]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so let me just set this up for us, _.filter = a function right, and we have an array, and then we have a callback function here. All right, so what's the first thing we need to do? We're gonna do some pseudocode, and then I'll write out the code, like we did yesterday.

[00:00:50]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: What's something that needs to be done?
>> Speaker 2: Loop through each item in the array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, we need to loop through the array, okay.
>> Speaker 2: Declare the array to return.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so we need to create a new array.
>> Speaker 3: Check if the callback returns true.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, where do we do that?

[00:01:11]

>> Speaker 2: Inside the loop.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, anything else?
>> Speaker 2: If it does return true, you push the item into the array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, and if it's false?
>> Speaker 2: Nothing.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Nothing, we move on with our lives. Awesome, so let's call this storage. We'll initialize that as an empty array.

[00:01:46]
So we can loop through our array, so we can do our for. Let's get fancy.
>> Speaker 2: Why are you consting the storage there?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I like to const.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I constant if it's a non-primitive value, but I don't have really strong opinions about when you should use const versus let, in var and stuff like that.

[00:02:29]
I like to use const, for sure, on functions because you never want to re assign a function. But no one ever does that. So, it's like, how important is it? I'm not one of those people who are arguing for something or the other. I'm more of a practical, get it done kind of person.

[00:02:51]
But we do need to do let here because it's gonna be reassigned. And it's a primitive value cuz it's a number. So that's the only thing that really matters in this. And probably, if you're gonna write library code, you don't want it to be reassigned, so you want want to take a lot of measures to prevent people from doing that.

[00:03:08]
More than probably just assigning it to const. Okay, so we're looping through, we need to check if the callback equals true, like this.
>> Speaker 2: To pass the current element?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's pass that current element, so that's array at i. Why are we using brackets again here?
>> Speaker 2: It's a variable.

[00:03:32]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cuz i is a variable. All right,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Now what?
>> Speaker 2: Storage.push. And then callback array on i. Sorry, no, you don't want the callback. You want just the array back.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you just pass the array at i. So we want to save the values that return true, not the callback with the item, because then you're just gonna get an array of true every time that wouldn't be as helpful for what we want to do.

[00:04:06]
All right,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And we're gonna return our array. return array, how we doing?
>> Speaker 2: Returning storage.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Thank you.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right.
>> Speaker 2: Do we have to add a case in for if array's an object?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: No, we don't need to, but,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Maybe think about how you might do that.

[00:04:46]
But for right now, this will get us through. Cool, any questions?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, on line nine. I guess this depends on how you write your callback but I didn't pass the second and third arguments, the i and the array again. So is that necessary in some way or are we getting something else from that?

[00:05:07]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Well, I do that just to make it as generic as possible just because we don't know what the callback needs. So we don't know, cuz the callback could be doing anything. And it might need the entire list, it might need the index. And it may need the value.

[00:05:25]
So, yeah, cool.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Any questions?
>> Speaker 2: So we've seen that question. The same line, line nine. The i would be relating to what part of the callback? Just the i by itself.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: This part right here?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So the question is, what does this i relate to?

[00:05:53]
Where were we defining i?
>> Speaker 2: On line 7.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so i starts at 0, and then every loop it's gonna increment by 1. So that's what it's related to. And if we change this here, it would go backwards if we had the right conditions, so that's how you define how the value changes every time.

[00:06:18]
So you can really do whatever you want there. You can add two if you want, you can double it every time, but typically we're just gonna increment it by one and we're gonna use arrays.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, good question. Did anyone write this with a each?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, all right, let's redo it with each.

[00:06:43]

>> Speaker 2: Online there's a question.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What's-
>> Speaker 2: Just in the if cb-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: No, you don't.
>> Speaker 2: You need the equal equal to true?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You don't necessarily need to do that. I like to be very explicit. But if you know for sure that this callback is gonna return true, or something truth-y, it will really force it into some Boolean in this if block.

[00:07:09]
But I just put it there to be clear for everyone. Good question, though. All right, so let's do it with each. And we're gonna replace our loop. Remember, whenever we have a loop we can probably use each or map. But definitely each, so, oops, I'm like doing something crazy.

[00:07:33]
So what is the thing that we want to pass, the list?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Do you guys remember?
>> Speaker 2: The array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: The array. And then what is our callback function?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we have our value, index and list.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So what do we want to do?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You want to check if the callback is true, right?

[00:08:09]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So really we could just pop this in here and change it a little bit. So If the callback,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Is true, storage.push.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: We can call it val. Sometimes I like to call this item.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cuz it's like an item in an array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And we'll get rid of this guy.

[00:08:42]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, and then if we wanna keep making it smaller, we can remove that. If we wanna keep making it smaller, we can just put this all on one line with no brackets.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: There's probably more ways we can shrink this. But we'll stop there.
