[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone really stoked to share what they did?
>> Speaker 2: Well, it's basically what we just saw earlier, right? So we need to have a temporary, or just return a slice.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, return Array.prototype.slice of what the array-like object that we passed to it.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, great, there you have it.

[00:00:29]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone do it differently?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: No, you did?
>> Speaker 3: I just used h [INAUDIBLE].
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, okay.
>> Speaker 4: Yeah, I was under the impression that we weren't supposed to use those other the prototype.slice.call, or the .from from ef6 so-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well, you can't use .from because that would be defining it with a definition.

[00:00:56]

>> Speaker 4: Right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, either way. Either way, cool, awesome. So, and just one reminder that functions are also objects, and you can add properties to them. So when you see functions like .call and things like that, that is because functions are also objects. So just know that .prototype, things like that, those are just properties on this object, a special kind of object that's a function.

[00:01:28]

>> Speaker 4: Was anybody's mind blown?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] [NOISE]
>> Speaker 4: Functions are objects.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
