[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so we're going to talk about advanced scope. So this is our second time talking about scope. Are you guys ready for this? This is gonna require us to do the thing where we run it together, so we have to be ready. So we gotta stretch and we're gonna do some advanced scope here.

[00:00:25]
Okay, so we have a function called alert. Let's just call it here. Normally, I would trick you into saying that it's already called but it hadn't actually been invoked yet. But since we're running low on time, I'll just skip to the meat of it. All right, who wants to go first?

[00:00:49]

>> Speaker 2: Constant of x is set to that string,
>> Speaker 2: Inside the function.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well first we have to set it up, then we call it.
>> Speaker 2: I thought we skipped that part too.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you're right, we didn't skip that part, but yeah, you're right. And then we do this, right, we save the string into the x constant, and then what happens?

[00:01:13]

>> Speaker 3: Then we set another constant alerter, which describes another function.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, typo.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Speaker 4: Then we run alerter and as in constant x into the alert method.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, do you know what alert does?
>> Speaker 4: It pops up on your window.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, it does, but only if you aren't masking it.

[00:01:43]
I hate that this, see how it has this bug. Anyway, I give up. You wanna rename this. This is gonna give us an error. So alert, this is gonna call itself. And it's gonna just go over cursing forever. So make sure that it's myAlert, cool? So we have an alert that pops up and it says, help, I think I found a clue.
