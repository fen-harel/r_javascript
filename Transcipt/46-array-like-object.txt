[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Great, so we're gonna talk about the arguments, array-like objects, a little bit more. But first, let's run this code, see what happens. Who wants to go first? Someone probably wants to go first cuz there's a crazy line here. So whoever goes first doesn't have to do that line.

[00:00:21]
For sure. No takers, you guys all want to do line two? All right, lets see, Jenny can you choose someone to go. [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 2: Lets say two people directly behind me. Is there, nope, there's no one directly behind me, sorry.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So am I starting it off?
>> Speaker 2: Yup.

[00:00:48]

>> Speaker 3: Or do line two?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It's a gift really cuz it's the easiest one. What's the very first thing that happens in this code block?
>> Speaker 3: So we declare accounts variable and give it a function.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so we're creating this definition somewhere in memory. Great, which way you wanna go, left or right?

[00:01:08]
Who do you like better?
>> Speaker 3: Ohhh!
>> Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Just kidding!
>> Speaker 3: I'm gonna go with my guy, Ben over there.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna skip! Okay.
>> Speaker 3: He's in my fantasy football team league.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 3: I lost to him last time, so [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

[00:01:24]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: And just so you know, it's gonna go this way now, so be prepared. Did you see that, Dan? It's gonna go this way, okay.
>> Speaker 3: So we just jumped over the declarations there, right?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so we jumped over the function body, and now we're-
>> Speaker 3: Now, we are currently calling the constructArr function with the Passing at the arguments was it in.

[00:01:44]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: That sounds really bad actually.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Man, ok, Dan?
>> Dan: The question is what is running next?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, what happens next?
>> Dan: The function body is going to get run?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so we'll jump into the function body, and then what happens?
>> Dan: New variables declared.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

[00:02:14]

>> Dan: Array or ARR.
>> Speaker 2: Yep.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: We declare a variable R, and we assign it to something crazy. Ryan, do you want to take a stab at what's happening?
>> Speaker 3: So you assign it to the arguments that were called, was it in. But prototype slice, I mean, you are going to create a slice of an array somehow, but I'm not really sure what mechanically happens at that point.

[00:02:49]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, a little bit crazy. What this does is it will take an array-like object and turn it into an array. So basically, what it's doing is it's referencing the slice method that comes with arrays,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And passing it that,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It's passing it the argument pseudo array as the context.

[00:03:20]
And as a result of that, it gets It turns an object like an array like object into an array, array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Does that make sense? You don't have to understand what this stuff is doing. Just know that this craziness is going to turn this argument's object into an array.

[00:03:46]
Yeah? Cool. And then.
>> Speaker 6: Is this the cannonical way of doing that, of taking that pseudo arguments array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Pretty much. Has anyone done it a different way?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, this is the way I've always done it.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so array is now an array that looks like what?

[00:04:14]
Let's just, man really? This is not how it's supposed to work, okay. So what is ARR look like at this point, Jenny? I'm going to write it out first.
>> Speaker 7: What does it look like at this point? I don't know what to say right now.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Sure. So do you remember what happened here?

[00:04:35]
In this craziness?
>> Speaker 7: Yeah, it took the string-looking array and turned it into an array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and so what does that array look like?
>> Speaker 7: So it's got the brackets and then the was it in separate pieces of the array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, exactly. Cool. And then, Josh what happens next?

[00:05:07]

>> Speaker 3: Push the billiards room onto that array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Speaker 3: So it ends up on the end.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What's that?
>> Speaker 3: It ends up on the end.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, so now we have an array that looks like this. The billiards room. And then, Altimere, what are we going to return?

[00:05:33]

>> Speaker 4: So, you do need some sort of manipulation with the join of that array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So, the join method is a native array method that's going to take all of the indices and join it with whatever character you give here, so I just put a space. So it's going to join it with the space.

[00:05:54]
So it'll say, was it in the billiards room?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So that's what we just did. How do we feel about that? Makes sense? Any questions about anything in there?
>> Speaker 7: Is it returning a string?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.
