[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: How'd it go, guys?
>> Speaker 2: I think I just don't understand exactly what you're looking for?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, I hear you.
>> Speaker 3: Were you trying to get the actual color strings, not the suspect objects?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Right, yeah.
>> Speaker 4: No.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So, let me rewrite this exercise. So destructure this nested data structure into two variables.

[00:00:29]
One variable should have the string red, and the next variable should have the string orange. Did anyone do that?
>> Speaker 3: I think so.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You think so.
>> Speaker 3: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: No worries, all right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Should we try it out?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So take a stab.
>> Speaker 3: So what I did is, I did const.

[00:01:01]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Speaker 3: FirstColor = game.suspects]0 .color, and then the same thing for the second color
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Got it.
>> Speaker 3: But just change the 0 to a 1.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Got it, ok so you're just using the bracket notation. Ok, so this is the task, but let's do this task With destructuring, which saves us from writing this.

[00:01:45]
Did anyone get there? You did?
>> Speaker 3: I think so.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see what you got. So var[color1, color2]
>> Speaker 3: Bracket, not dot. I'm sorry, the Curly bracket or square bracket? Not curly bracket, just square bracket.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Where, okay, okay.
>> Speaker 3: Equals open {suspects[0].color, suspects[1].color} And with a semicolon.

[00:02:37]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, what do you guys think, is that going to do it?
>> Speaker 5: Yes
>> Speaker 3: But with just normal, not the curly brackets around the outer, yeah
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, like this, cool cause it is in there right. Alright, did anyone do it a different way? No? So there is also this way, where you do.

[00:03:32]

>> [INAUDIBLE].
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So that's another way of doing it. So then it's assigning orange to firstColor, and red to secondColor. So as you can see there are a few ways of doing it
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Questions?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: No? No questions.
>> Speaker 6: Why is the, basically so the, I see what you just did with line 16 there, is you made a variable first color and that lined up with the color property.

[00:04:28]
And so, I'm curious then why, you know, it feels like basically, or if you're assigning this value to the variable firstColor, usually that's on the left. How did that kinda work there in you to look for.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, yeah.
>> Speaker 6: The named property color, and then gave that value firstColor?

[00:04:50]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so how it works under the hood, I'm not quite sure.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It's just backwards than what you would expect. Is it kinda like if you were to read that in English?
>> Speaker 6: It would say for the first color property we find, call that first color, make a variable.

[00:05:14]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Which is the first index of an array, of the array.
>> Speaker 6: And so each index of the array is with a new kind of object, like we are doing there with a color segment, color code.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, and so if we wanted to do something a little simpler, to draw a parallel.

[00:05:34]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: We could do this
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So this is similar to, sorry, actually, I don't need to do that.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So that's what I did, and that gives you not just the color, but the whole object with the name and the color. Yeah, but you can see that this is just specifying a little deeper, in that nested if structure.

[00:06:10]
Yeah, it's a little bit of a mind bender
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So you might be about to go into this then but, is there a way where we can do that, without knowing how many objects we have total? Like how nested it is?
>> Speaker 6: Well, if were to add on simple suspects to that list.

[00:06:33]

>> Speaker 3: Could you repeat the question, I can't hear you.
>> Speaker 6: Is there a way to do that, then, without knowing the number of suspects? Basically to iterate through each object on that subjects, or on that suspects array, excuse me.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Directly, in the destructioning notation, I don't think that you can do that.

[00:06:52]
I think you can use a spread operator and turn it into an array, or something like that. The remainder, turn it into an array, but that's not exactly answering your question.
