>> Bianca: So we're gonna do something called projecting, which is basically when you take a value out of a data structure and turn it into another data structure. It's just a fancy name for that you might find in functional programming libraries or literature. But basically all we wanna do is, we're gonna reference this data structure here.

>> Bianca: And you could actually do it in the jspin if you want. But I just put it in here so that you can copy it.
>> Speaker 2: Is that the same one we were using earlier?
>> Bianca: Is it the same one? Yes, it is.
>> Bianca: So, before we filtered it, and then we wanna map it into an array of strings so we filtered it into an array of objects, now we wanna map it into an array of strings so the output should look something like

>> Bianca: Something like this.
>> Bianca: Right? So just building on the previous exercise.
