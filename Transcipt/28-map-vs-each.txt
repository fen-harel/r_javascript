>> Bianca Gandolfo: So now we understand how to implement it. I couldn't find a free version of a broken pipe, of all things, so there's [LAUGH] my stock photo. So yeah, here's our broken weapons. We have a list of broken stuff, cool? So we transformed our list.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome, so

[00:00:27]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Here's our example from before where we have our, and I do have a typo here.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, where were we, okay. So we're mapping through our suspects, right? Remember before this was a suspects list, and we just had an array. We were looping and pushing it. Now we don't have to do that.

[00:00:58]
We'll just map through our suspects for each name. We'll create an object and we'll return it. And it will create a suspects list.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone wanna see this in action? Yeah or no? Yeah, okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So this is a more realistic application of map, right?

[00:01:44]
Rather than concatenating strings, we're creating objects and returning them. And then we can each through them and call each one.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Suspect.speak? Cuz we need suspectsList.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What is it?
>> Speaker 2: It's cuz of your log instead of console dot.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, well, you guys get the gist, right?

[00:02:26]
The gist is life is hard. Editing Chrome tools is hard. Okay, so here's another version of that just with the each from before to compare.
