>> Bianca Gandolfo: So what about passing arguments to functions? So here we have this increment function. And I apologize for this example, it's the most cliche example, but here we are. So we have an increment function, right, we're defining a function, it takes n and it returns n + 1.

[00:00:20]
Then we have the square function, it takes n and it returns n times n, okay? So this one's gonna square it, this one's gonna increment it. And this is our function, it says doMathSoIDontHaveTo. This function takes n and it takes a callback function, and it returns that function with n passed to it.

[00:00:42]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone have a question about what I just said?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so, doMathSoIDontHaveTo takes n and it takes a function. Returns that function with n invoked as an argument. So in this case, doMathSoIDontHaveTo takes 5, so n is 5, square, right, this function as func. And so this is square with 5 which equals, 25, yeah.

[00:01:19]
[LAUGH] You guys make me laugh.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So not interested in entertaining me like a kindergartner. So this one is doMathSoIDontHaveTo, we pass 4, n is 4, increment, which is this function that increments. Func is increment and we return increment n, which is then?
>> Speaker 2: 5.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, I was thinking it was 6 for some reason but it's 5.
