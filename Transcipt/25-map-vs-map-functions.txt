>> Bianca Gandolfo: Little bit of a mind bender. Map is very similar, but there's a key difference that I wanna point out. So, here's underscore map. Again, there's native array map method, which we won't implement. You can write it out just the same as you would write for each except.

[00:00:22]
Instead of for each you put map.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Obviously, the behavior is different because its not each. And we'll go onto that. So the key difference between each and map that people really confuse is that each does not return anything. The function does not return anything. Okay, that's really important.

[00:00:45]
So, even if you wanted to return something in your callback function, you can't. It just doesn't work like that. Cool? You guys promise you won't forget? Okay, and then map returns an array every time.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So map, we use it to take lists and transform them into,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: A new array.

[00:01:20]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So you can use it really to just copy an array, if you wanted. But typically, you're going to use it to manipulate change, update it and move it around, however you want. So.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It looks a little similar. So we take a list and then we have a callback function.

[00:01:40]
And we call each one with this function, except that whatever this function returns It's going to go on the object. What does this function return? What does it return?
>> Speaker 2: Just a value.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What value is it returning?
>> Speaker 2: 1, 2, and 3.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: That function? Where does this?

[00:02:12]
So the only place it returns is In ES5 at least it's where you say return and so we're not saying return here and so what it's returning is undefined in this case. And so we're gonna loop through and we're gonna have an array of length three of undefined values.

[00:02:36]
That makes sense? Why is it length three?
>> Speaker 2: Each iteration of the original array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Because the original array is length three. Exactly, so for this utility method, it's going to return,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: An array of the same size every time. That's how it works.
