[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Our task is to loop through the suspects array.
>> Speaker 2: So I named a function, foo.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Like that?
>> Speaker 2: Yep, brackets.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Speaker 2: Set up a for loop, so for (let i = 0;
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Speaker 2: i < game.length; i++).
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Great. What does this kind of loop do?

[00:00:43]

>> Speaker 2: It's going to advance through the members of the array.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What does this mean right here?
>> Speaker 2: It declares the sort of iterative variable.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 2: And starts it at 0.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 2: And then will go through the number of the members of array as specified by the length of the array.

[00:01:09]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so while this is true, it will increment by one.
>> Speaker 2: That's right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, why did you choose this kind of loop?
>> Speaker 2: Because, don't really necessarily know the number of the members in advance. So if you added any, it would be dynamic based on it's length, basically.

[00:01:39]
So if you ever add in members to the array it would still be workable. So, console.log
>> Speaker 2: (game[i]);
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What do we think? Is it gonna work?
>> Speaker 2: I think it's gonna log suspects when we do call function.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You think it's gonna log suspects?
>> Speaker 2: We didn't call the function there.

[00:02:26]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so we didn't call the function. That's a problem.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And then when we call it, we're going to loop through, and you think it's going to call suspects, why?
>> Speaker 2: I was just playing around with it and I think that's what happened to me, but I think, yeah, at that first level of the game object, the only thing it has is this object suspects, which is in array.

[00:02:55]
So, at that level of like game.whatever, there's only suspects. So, there should be a length of just one, and it will return that array of objects.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Got it. I see what you're saying, but it's an object, so object doesn't have a length. So that's a problem. For the very first time that this loops runs, what is i?

[00:03:24]
How about checkered flag?
>> Speaker 2: i is,
>> Speaker 2: i is,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] Probably gonna, I was like.
>> Speaker 2: The object, the game of object itself.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Where are we saying that i is the game object? What line?
>> Speaker 2: It'd be
>> Speaker 2: 14, because, yeah, 15, console.log(game[i]), and at that point, i is,

[00:04:12]

>> Speaker 2: Actually, i is, game.length is going to be
>> Bianca Gandolfo: If you said type of i, what do you think it is supposed to be?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: A number. Do you see where we're assigning it to a number?
>> Speaker 3: Yeah, in line 14 where you're saying let i = 0.

[00:04:38]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 3: 0 is the starting iteration number.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so at this line this is where we are defining i, and we're starting it out at zero. So in the very first loop what do you think i is?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Well we're setting it. I.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry.

[00:04:59]
It's 0.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Zero.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. So i is 0 on the very first loop, so then is i less than game.length.?
>> Speaker 2: So is game.length undefined or is it zero?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I think it's undefined.
>> Speaker 2: So, [COUGH] we could fix it by game.suspects.length.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And that-

[00:05:27]

>> Speaker 2: And that will have a length then because it's an array, not an object.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and then game.i, right? So i is 0, we can kind of replace it like that. What is game at 0?
>> Speaker 2: Game at 0 should-
>> Speaker 3: Shouldn't it be game.suspects?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, because there is no games at 0.

[00:05:49]
Perfect. Any questions about that and how that works?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So this is a little tricky. It's like one of those easy things that people give magic to, and really it's telling you everything that it's doing. So we're defining where our start variable is, right? We're giving it a condition, while this condition is true, and then every loop, do a thing, right, and it's gonna increment.

[00:06:30]
You can increment it multiple times or whatever. So there isn't anything magic happening here. We use them a lot with arrays.
>> Speaker 2: Someone in the chat rooms getting fancy with for each.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Nice. We'll get there in the next-
>> Speaker 2: Get there?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 2: Or game? Is it a fair game to also use map?

[00:06:56]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm. You could use map if you wanna return an array. Yeah, we're gonna, in the next slides after this, we do each in map, yeah. Awesome. So where was I? Yeah, so there's no magic here. Why do we use this kind of loop with an array, and would you use this with an object?

[00:07:22]

>> Speaker 2: Well with an array, arrays have numerical values associated with them. So they map well onto the way this literates.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, exactly, and that's it. So this loop has really nothing to do with arrays, we have a for end loop, right, which is actually for objects.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Which has a special relationship, but this for loop is just doing math.

[00:07:54]
It's very straightforward.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, any questions?
>> Speaker 2: Could you also use brackets? So it would be game.["suspects"].length?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you could also do that. I don't recommend using brackets when you don't have to. I use it in my examples just to remind you that that's a thing that exists, but in general if you can do a dot, it saves you four or so keystrokes.

[00:08:29]
I think thatâ€™s best, and we have to use brackets here, why?
>> Speaker 2: Me?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 2: Because.
>> Speaker 2: All because, I guess you can use a dot if key was like a property on the object, which in this case it's not a property of it, it's just like a variable.

[00:09:05]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep. What's the giveaway that it's a variable?
>> Speaker 2: Let?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, let.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and you can leave this off to be honest, but that's the giveaway, and you could change this
>> Bianca Gandolfo: To whatever you want. It's just a variable name. I like to show that by just calling it pickly, that's what it's gonna be.

[00:09:38]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: It just needs to match, awesome.
