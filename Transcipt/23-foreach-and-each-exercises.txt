>> Bianca Gandolfo: So for the exercise, we're gonna first start by implementing the internals of an each function, right? So, just remember that e ach takes two arguments, a list, and a callback. It's going to iterate through each item in that list and call that callback with the values in that list, one at a time, right?

[00:00:24]
So if we have a list of like three, it's gonna call the callback three times each with one of those values. Also, _ .each works for both arrays and objects, so that's something to consider. Once you finish, you can test it by using it with the exercise from the previous module.

Where we look through our suspects list and created suspect objects. So good luck. Also don't forget that, this is a little tricky here, is that the underscore is gonna be an object.
