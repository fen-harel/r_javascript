>> Bianca: Our challenge was to rewrite this function in ES6. Step one, would be to identify what feature exists that isn't available in ES6, and that is this default parameter. So we have to work with what we've got.
>> Bianca: And the most common way, my goodness, look at all of this craziness.

[00:00:22]
The most common way, okay, let's move over. The most common way to do this is to simply, it's all kinds of weird. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Is to say b equals b, all right, so if b has value, great or what was it? Two? Yeah, that's how we did it before.

[00:01:05]
Any questions?
>> Bianca: Has anyone done this before in their code? Yeah? Raise your hand if you have. A couple people about half of us, yeah. So what this is is the OR operator. So this will only evaluate one side if it's true. So it'll say, if this is true, it'll just stop, and it'll just return, great.

[00:01:37]
For the AND operator, this is good for if you wanted to check if something is true, then do the second thing. So this one says, if the exists then the values two. So it's kind of a little bit unusual way of using these logic operators as a way to kind of do if-else kind of statements in one line.

[00:02:07]
But that's the most common one, just like that. Cool, have you guys seen things like this?
>> Bianca: We're using the if and the and.
